# The Equation Invasion
In my Mathematics Capstone class, we were given the task of creating a project to display, use, and hone our skills. I chose to use the skills I've gained in both my majors, Computer Science and Math, to make a web application where the user is able to play a math game.
## Game Information
The game is wave based, where the user will "defend" their castle from the impending doom of math equations. Basic Math problems and algebra will be included for easy-mild difficulty!
